    "# 10 Heatmaps 10 Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently watched Jake VanderPlas' amazing PyCon2017 talk on the landscape of [Python Data Visualization](https://youtu.be/FytuB8nFHPQ). That presentation inspired this post. In programming, we often see the same ['Hello World'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) or Fibonacci style program implemented in multiple programming languages as a comparison. In Jake's presentation, he shows the same scatter plot in several of the libraries he featured. Below, I am following the same formula. I am recreating the same chart, a heatmap about airline flights, in ten different python visualization libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am also launching a public github repo [Python-Viz-Compared](https://github.com/AlgorexHealth/python-viz-compared) for these comparison notebooks. Each Jupyter notebook will contain one chart (bar, scatter etc) and then up to 10 different ways of implementing them. But for this post, we are going to start with HeatMaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "### the challenge\n",
    "How easy is it to take a matrix or 2d array and convert it to a heatmap with custom color scaling? \n",
    "\n",
    "Jake gave us a good chart sorting out the various approaches of these libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "<script async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-slide=\"35\" data-id=\"a2d86983ff634ac3871ad4e5a308a67b\" data-ratio=\"1.33333333333333\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"></script>\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking Jake's lead , let's summarize the various quadrants shown here: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Upper Right Purple: Matplotlib Family** These libraries keep matplotlib as a versatile battle-tested back end but provide streamlined domain specific APIs. \n",
    "* **Upper Left Turquoise: Browser JS** Build a new API that results in a javascript serialization of a plot for display in a browser. \n",
    "* **Lower Right Red: Declarative Visualization** Following a open, cross-platform specification language the data, and visualization can be rendered in any back end by any language. \n",
    "* **Everything Else:** This includes a lot of other stuff from platforms that support server-side rendering of streaming data to libraries that leverage GPU platforms specifically. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to refer to this system as the VanderPlas taxonomy. So with that overview, let dive in to our challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Update: Just after posting I cam across this amazingly written post [A Dramatic Tour through Python’s Data Visualization Landscape](https://dsaber.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/) and I am sorry I didn't have the creativity to equal it*\n"

    "As you can see, Bokeh is one of the more verbose implementations of this chart so far. But, I will admit I am homer for Bokeh. That verbosity reveals an underlying complexity where you can literally map everything. What makes it verbose is the manipulation of the properties (labels, colors, dataranges) but those properties follow a logical grammar and  are easy to find. The label to identify the x-axis is simply the `xaxis.axis_label`. Likewise, the font size of the title is simply `title.text_font_size`.\n",

    "The second major advantage of Bokeh is it's unique way of linking the data between plots. Notice the `ColumnDataSource`above. Say if we wanted to add a table or line graph from the same underlying dataframe, Bokeh would automatically recognize that the graphs shared the same data source and update them together. The charts could be updated from a widget like a dropdown box or radio button. In this way, Bokeh is works like [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) from the R ecosystem. Some simple jinja templates and Bokeh server functionality allow the construction of rich visualizations and web apps. \n",

[Holoviews](http://holoviews.org) has the very ambitious goal of \"letting data visualize itself.\" So for holoviews, the aim of the designers is to have you state what you want to learn and pass in the data and then the library will infer the various variables and create the chart. In fact, bokeh is not even the only backend supported. The team has a backend interface to matplotlib and also to plotly, though these do not have feature parity with the bokeh backend yet. \n",

    "One line of code is all that took. Very cool! Let me explain a little bit about what happened. Holoviews seperates the style from the substance. When plotting with holoviews, the various plot types HeatMap, Scatter etc look for a combination of value dimensions (*vdims*) and key dimensions (*kdims*). So our data contained in `flight_rows`, has two *kdims* (month, year) and one *vdim* (passengers). So when we invoke `hv.Heatmap` it can immediatly infer the correct display. The style is all handled seperatly through declared options which can be invoked globally through cell or line magics in Jupyter Notebooks. \n",

    "Altair is one of the newer libraries on the block. It was started by a team incluing Jake VanderPlas and is being supported by the [Interactive Data Lab @ the University of Washington](https://idl.cs.washington.edu). Altair is part of an ecosystem surronding [Vega](https://vega.github.io) a JSON specification format that renders using the D3 visualization library. Given the power and amazing influence of [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery), Vega, and Altair (they are both stars in the summer triangle) promise a much easier interface and implementation of visualizations. \n",

    "Becasue this will end up as JSON, an attribute getting a single value can be set directly, such as `column='year'`, but when more arguments are needed, you have to call it like a class method. Thus, `color=Color('passengers', color=Color('passengers', scale=Scale(type='linear', range=['#bfd3e6', '#6e016b']))` gets transformed into the following JSON. \n",

    "The only problem with this chart is that the color scale is not the full `BuPu` brewer scale rather it is simply a scale between the two colors as written.

However, it [does not appear](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/blob/master/altair/notebooks/10-Heatmaps.ipynb) that altair does not support passing those colormaps to scales yet.

    "Referring back to the VanderPlas taxonomy, [Lightnig Viz](http://lightning-viz.org) is in the everything else category. Like plotly, it is cross-platform with a javascript client api for R, Scala, and javascript. Also, it relies on communication with a server that handles much of the difficult rendering. However, it is released under MIT license so its completly free to use and improve. When you develop in a notebook environment like this post, you can choose to use a public lightning server maintained by the development team or you can one click deploy a server via heroku, docker or other service.

    "And we have a new winner for the easiest implementation of our chart. Lightning really did perform this task in one line of code. We could nitpick that there is no way to add a title but really this was impressive. The server also adds a bunch of functionality that would otherwise not be availble (unles you are using plotly). Each chart gets its own unique URL so they can be shared and passed through an organization. The server even includes a mini-wizard for users to build their own visualizations [without code](http://lightning-viz.org/usage/#client). The server also makes these visualizations really fast because it does some magic to customize the javascript and cache results. This is especially helpful if you are going to stream in data requiring constant updates. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Do you need publication worthy images for a journal or PDF? Pick matplotlib, seaborn or any of the libraries that use an matplotlib backend. This is because matplotlib has the most numerous outputs to render the chart as an image and is natively supported by nbconvert for jupyter notebooks. I should say that altair and bokeh are making strides in this area. But they rely on massive external libraries (often written in Node) to consistently generate the outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Do you plan on building a large set of dashboards or custom web-application with these charts? Then I would consider any of bokeh, plot.ly, lightning, or altair. They are built for browsers and and support adding interactivity through signaling and widgets. Lightning especially will help speed up the delivery of these charts and the caching/sharing of the results will ease your client-side loads. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Are you a statistician data scientist who just wants to explore data? I'd consider holoviews or seaborn whose APIs focus on bivariate, univariate tests based on inbound data. The styling may be dense and tricky to navigate but styling isn't your chief concern. \n",
